# requirejs-bootstrap
Project Bootstrap for requirejs based web applications. Very minimalistic!!!

To start developing project simply type 
 
``npm install``
 
#release-build
 
The project supports a release-build command, which uses requirejs's capabilities to optimize all
``*.js`` and ``*.css`` files. 

For MacOS and Unix/Linux systems simply call 

``npm run release``

For Windows use 

``npm run release-win``

The release version is inside the ``.dist/`` directory.

That's all, folks!
